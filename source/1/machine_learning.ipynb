    "by Bart De Vylder and Pieter Buteneers from CoScale\n",

    "\n",
    "## Intro \n",
    "Machine learning is a method to automate the building of models based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed, machine learning techniques are developed to learn models by themselves and are able to respond to new incoming data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A distinction is typically made between supervised machine learning and unsupervised machine learning. In **supervised machine learning**, the algorithm is given the expected outputs (labels) for at least some of the input data. It's the algorithms task to find a pattern such that it can generate correct outputs for unseen cases (generalization). The (automated) evaluation of an algorithm's performance can be done by comparing the predicted outcome to the actual one. The exercises in this notebook are of the supervised kind.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **unsupervised machine learning**, no labels of the input data are provided. It's the algorithm job to find useful structure in the provided data. There is no standard way to (automatically) evaluate the performance/accurancy of an unsupervised machine learning problem. An example of unsupervised machine learing is clustering (we'll see an example of this in the correlation and clustering section). \n",

    "## Topics\n",

    "* train, validation and test sets\n",
    "* overfitting\n",
    "* cross-validation\n",
    "* reguralization\n",

    "Let's first start with importing all the necessary packages. Some imports will be repeated in the exercises but if you want to skip some parts you can just execute the imports below and start with any exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see we also import packages from `__future__`. This is to improve the compatibility with Python 3, but will not guarantee it."
